# UFO Sightings Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The analysis was brought out to offer some in-depth defined criterias to users to get an understanding of the details of UFO sightings. Users are allowed input a specifc city, state, country or shape, or combine these criterias to define the search.  
The analysis procedure was conducted through JavaScript.

## Results  
A website was created with the following components:   
* A navigation bar, which allows the users to refresh the page and reset the search
* A page header,
* An title for the article,
* A paragraph of the article,
* Multiple filters, which allows users to search different criteria,  
* And a table to show the filtered sighting data.  
Below is a picture of the page.

Below is an example of how to use the filter search function to look at data from different criterias. As I entered the date as 1/13/2010 and the state as "pa", the website has filtered out the UFO sighting information met these two requirements.

## Summary  
This website indeed provides convenient and straight foward methods for users to navigate through datas. However, this is a drawback with it. Due to large size of the data, it is difficult for users to go through all the datas to identiful the specific options under each filter. For example, a user might not know which state to enter if they have no idea about the range of states the datasets includes.   
Some recommendation to add to it are:  
1. Add a drop list to each filter to allow users to pick.
2. Add a count at the bottom of the table to show the total number of UFOs for each defined search.
