# UFO Sightings Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The analysis was brought out to offer some in-depth defined criterias to users to get an understanding of the details of UFO sightings. Users are allowed input a specifc city, state, country or shape, or combine these criterias to define the search.  
The analysis procedure was conducted through JavaScript.

## Results  
A website was created with the following components:   
* A navigation bar, which allows the users to refresh the page and reset the search
* A page header,
* An title for the article,
* A paragraph of the article,
* Multiple filters, which allows users to search different criteria,  
* And a table to show the filtered sighting data.  
Below is a picture of the page.

Below is an example of how to use the filter search function to look at data from different criterias. As I entered the date as 1/13/2010 and the state as "pa", the website has filtered out the UFO sighting information met these two requirements.
